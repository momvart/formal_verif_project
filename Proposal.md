In computer science, property testing is to query a structure (or system) to determine whether it satisfies a certain property or is "far" from it.
A property testing algorithm for a problem has a lower query complexity to its input in comparison with the problem instance size.

Proptest is a property testing framework for programs written in Rust language. It allows testing that certain properties of the code hold for "arbitrary" inputs.


So, basically, the proptest crate claims that the inputs that are generated for a sample program based on a certain property, are reduced to a minimal test case in order to simplify the 
process of finding the point of failure, But the definition of "minimal" and "how" to reach that minimal input varies on a case-to-case basis.

Our questions which we are going to solve are:
Is the proptest generated test case actually minimal in all scenarios? If it is, can we prove it?
If the generated test case is not minimal, how can we reduce it to a better value? (by "better" we mean something that causes finding the point of failure in the program simpler)

We think that a possible solution can consist of the generation of some Rust programs and testing them with the proptest framework and trying to find a better and more reduced test case than what has
been generated by the proptest. If we could find such a thing, it means that the test cases or obviously not minimal in all cases, if we could not, we shall delve into the test case generation mechanism and try to extract its corresponding formula in order to deal with it.

It will be either mathematical modeling and proof, or it will some modifications in the proptest crate code which will be done using the Rust platform. We might need to leverage some solvers as well, in which case Z3 might be a good option.

By the date that we should present our demo, we want to be pretty sure about the minimality of test cases in proptest and propose a detailed plan for the next steps (which will be either a proof or a modification to proptest crate).
